# Batch-scripts
Simple Batch scripts to do useful things

Compare Files.bat
	drag two files onto this script to run a file compare on them

Jekel-Hyde.bat
	drag a file onto this script for a prompt to change the file extention. I use it to quickly convert .txt files to .bat files.

Shutdown Prog.bat
	Run this script to schedule a delayed shutdown of your system. Useful for overnight downloads.
	Run Shutdown cancel.bat if you need to cancel a scheduled shutdown.
